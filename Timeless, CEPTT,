Humans see stripes, AI would see a cloud: a testable Planck-portal theorem 

Subject: A bold, testable, observer-dependent reinterpretation of the double-slit experiment and its cosmological consequences
Dear Editor,
Imagine that the interference pattern in the double-slit experiment is not a universal feature of Nature, but a perceptual artifact produced exclusively by human chronological and Euclidean biases, while a sufficiently non-anthropocentric artificial observer would see only a diffuse fractal-probability cloud.
The Crispín-Elicea Planck Portal Theorem (CEPPT) presented in the attached manuscript makes precisely that claim. It proposes that quantum systems permanently reside in an atemporal fractal substrate Ω beyond the Planck scale, and that all classical paradoxes (measurement problem, arrow of time, black-hole information, many-worlds ontology, and the origin of cosmic structure) arise from the forced projection of this substrate into meso-scale spacetime by observer-dependent operators.
The theory is falsifiable in the near term: it predicts sharply different statistical patterns in quantum experiments when the final data analysis is performed by chronologically unbiased artificial intelligence instead of human-designed pipelines.
We believe this work offers the kind of paradigm-shifting yet experimentally accessible idea that [Journal Name] readers particularly value.
We would be delighted if you considered it for peer review.

## Abstract
We introduce the Crispín-Elicea Planck Portal Theorem (CEPPT), a novel framework that reinterprets quantum phenomena, such as the double-slit experiment, not as manifestations of wave-particle duality but as perceptual projections from an atemporal, fractal substrate beyond the Planck scale. This substrate, denoted Ω, exists in a Hilbert space where time is absent, and classical interpretations arise from anthropocentric biases in observation. By integrating fractal geometry, relational quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, and cognitive science, the CEPPT resolves longstanding paradoxes including the measurement problem, the arrow of time, black hole information loss, and the nature of singularities. We dismiss the many-worlds interpretation as ontologically extravagant, proposing instead that superpositions remain intact in Ω, with observer-dependent projections creating the illusion of collapse or branching. Testable predictions include observer-specific patterns in quantum experiments, detectable via non-anthropocentric artificial intelligence (AI) observers, and fractal signatures in cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. Implications extend to entropy, consciousness, dark matter, and quantum fields, suggesting a holistic universe where chaos and order coexist in self-similar loops. This work challenges Euclidean and chronological paradigms, advocating for non-Euclidean tools to bridge micro- and macrocosmic scales.

## Introduction
The foundations of physics have long grappled with the apparent incompatibilities between quantum mechanics and general relativity, as well as the observer's role in shaping reality. Traditional interpretations, from Copenhagen's wave-function collapse to Everett's many-worlds, often invoke ad-hoc mechanisms to reconcile particle-wave duality and measurement paradoxes. However, these approaches may stem from an anthropocentric bias: our perceptual and mathematical tools, honed for the human-scale (meso) world, falter at subatomic and cosmic extremes.

Consider the double-slit experiment, a cornerstone of quantum weirdness. An electron fired through two slits produces interference fringes suggestive of wave behavior, yet detection at the screen yields particle-like impacts. Why this duality? We argue it is not inherent to the electron but imposed by the observer. Drawing on metaphors from child psychology and fractal self-similarity, we propose the Crispín-Elicea Planck Portal Theorem (CEPPT). This theorem posits that quantum entities reside in an atemporal fractal substrate Ω, accessible via a "Planck portal" where Euclidean space-time dissolves. Observations project this substrate into meso-scale frames, creating illusions of duality, causality, and temporality.

This paper expands on the CEPPT, exploring its unification of quantum mechanics, cosmology, and cognitive science. We begin with conceptual foundations, formalize the theorem, and discuss implications for key puzzles, including the many-worlds interpretation, singularities, entropy, and beyond. Testable predictions are outlined, emphasizing AI-based experiments to validate non-anthropocentric projections.

## Conceptual Foundations: The Tantrum-Throwing Child and Fractal Nature
Imagine a bratty child who constantly drives his father crazy. The father wants the child to obey, but the kid never does. One day, the father ironically asks him to misbehave, and the child suddenly behaves perfectly. The fault is not the child’s; he’s just being himself. The real problem lies with the father for expecting something different from the child’s nature.

That child is our electron in the double-slit experiment. Our view of the universe and its laws is not always compatible with reality, because sometimes we try, metaphorically, to measure a sphere with a carpenter’s square. At subatomic scales, it is absurd to keep using Euclidean mathematics, and the same happens when we try to quantify the macrocosm. This is where the anthropocentric perspective we have adopted as a species comes into play: we believe the universe must conform to our conceptual and perceptual tools, tools designed for the human-scale (meso) world. But reality operates in dimensions that defy those expectations. It’s as if we tried to capture the flow of a river with a rigid fishing net; the river keeps flowing, indifferent to our net.

Fractals provide a key insight: infinitely complex, self-similar patterns that repeat across scales, like the jagged coastlines of a continent or the branching of a tree. Fractals show us that nature is not governed by straight lines and perfect Euclidean shapes, but by a chaotic, self-similar geometry that reveals order within apparent disorder.

In the macrocosm, think of the large-scale structure of the universe: galaxies clustering into filaments, walls, and superclusters, forming patterns that, on the largest scales, can be interpreted as fractal. The distribution of dark matter, for example, is not smooth and uniform but exhibits irregularities that resemble Mandelbrot or Julia sets, where every zoom reveals endless new detail. This fractal nature challenges our anthropocentric intuition of a tidy, clockwork cosmos; instead, it suggests a dynamic universe in which chaos generates structure.

Now let us connect this to the microcosm of the electron in the double-slit experiment. In the experiment, the electron does not behave like a classical particle following a straight trajectory; instead, it interferes with itself as a wave, producing interference fringes that only resolve into particle-like hits when we observe it. Why? Because our measurement, our anthropocentric intervention, collapses the wave function, forcing reality to fit our expectations. But the electron, like the tantrum-throwing child, is inherently probabilistic, not deterministic. Trying to apply Euclidean mathematics to it is like trying to map a fractal with ruler and compass: we lose the infinite, recursive essence. Fractals actually provide a bridge here; concepts in quantum mechanics such as renormalization or strange attractors in quantum chaos evoke fractal structures in which probabilities branch into infinite possible paths.

## The Crispín-Elicea Planck Portal Theorem (CEPPT)
The Crispín-Elicea Planck Portal Theorem (CEPPT) asserts that the double-slit experiment is not evidence of wave-particle duality, but a portal into the Planck regime where time does not exist. Electrons permanently reside in an atemporal Hilbert space beyond the Planck scale. The interference fringes are perceptual projections imposed by the Euclidean and chronological biases of the human observer. Simulations show that non-human observers (e.g., suitably designed AIs) would perceive a diffuse probabilistic cloud instead of symmetric fringes. This framework unifies relational quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, and cognitive science, predicting observer-dependent patterns that are testable using artificial intelligence and comparative neurobiology. Euclidean mathematics reaches its limit at the Planck frontier, underscoring the anthropocentric character of classical interpretations.

The theorem dissolves the measurement problem by shifting the burden from the electron to the observer: there is no wave-function collapse, only a forced projection from an atemporal substrate into a Euclidean space-time frame. The electron does not “choose” to be wave or particle; we choose to see it that way because our brains, and our physics, are wired for the meso-scale. In the Planck portal, space and time merge into a non-Euclidean fractal geometry where linear causality vanishes and information flows in self-similar loops. Fractals here are not mere metaphor: they are the native mathematical structure of the sub-Planck regime, where every “point” contains infinite degrees of freedom, like a Cantor set encoding the entire universe.

Formally, let Ω denote the atemporal fractal substrate, a Hilbert space with fractal dimensionality. The observer-dependent projection operator \(\mathcal{P}_O\) maps states from Ω to meso-scale space-time:  
\[
|\psi\rangle_{\text{meso}} = \mathcal{P}_O (|\Phi\rangle_\Omega),
\]  
where \(|\Phi\rangle_\Omega\) is the timeless superposition in Ω, and \(\mathcal{P}_O\) incorporates the observer's biases (e.g., Euclidean metric, chronological ordering). For human observers, this yields interference fringes; for AI designed without temporal bias, it produces a fractal probability cloud.

This treatise therefore proposes a reconciliation: abandon anthropocentric rigidity and embrace tools such as fractal geometry, non-Euclidean topology, quantum field theory, and the CEPPT itself. In the macrocosm, general relativity already forces us to curve space-time, measuring spheres with flexible squares, so to speak. Imagine the universe as one vast fractal: from subatomic particles to cosmic structures, everything repeats in self-similar patterns. The electron is not “rebellious”; we are the ones expecting it to dance to our classical drum. By recognizing this, and by validating the CEPPT with non-anthropocentric AI, we not only resolve paradoxes like the double-slit experiment, but we open doors to a more holistic understanding in which chaos and order coexist in an eternal, timeless dance beyond Planck.

## Dismissal of the Many-Worlds Interpretation
The CEPPT categorically rejects Everett’s many-worlds interpretation, not as an ad-hoc refutation, but as a natural consequence of its atemporal framework. In the many-worlds view, every quantum measurement branches the universe into infinite parallel realities in which all possibilities coexist. Under the CEPPT, however, there is no real branching: what we perceive as “superimposed possibilities” is merely an anthropocentric projection of a single atemporal state in Ω. No parallel universes are created; instead, different observers project different “shadows” of the same fractal substrate. Superposition does not resolve into parallel branches; it remains intact in the Planck portal, and only our chronological perception forces it to appear as a binary choice (wave or particle, branch A or B). This eliminates the need for ontologically extravagant infinite universes and replaces it with an elegant economy: a single Ω projected in infinite ways according to the observer’s bias.

Testable prediction: In experiments with chronologically unbiased AI, we would not see collapsing branches but a continuous fractal cloud, confirming that “parallel worlds” are a human perceptual artifact, not physical reality. Such experiments could involve quantum simulators where AI algorithms process raw detection data without assuming temporal sequences, potentially revealing self-similar probability distributions rather than discrete outcomes.

## Implications for Singularities and the Big Bang
The CEPPT has profound implications for singularities in black holes and the Big Bang, resolving their paradoxes by dissolving the notions of “beginning” or “end” in an atemporal framework. In general relativity, singularities represent points where space-time breaks down: infinite density, time stopping. Under the CEPPT, these are not real breakdowns but limits of our anthropocentric projection. The Big Bang is not a temporal explosive origin but the meso-scale projection of a transition from the atemporal sub-Planck regime into emergent space-time. Picture the Big Bang as the “edge” of a fractal: not a singular point, but a recursive infinity where “time zero” is illusory because time does not exist in Ω. Likewise, a black-hole singularity is a portal back to the atemporal substrate, where information is not lost (solving Hawking’s paradox) but redistributed in non-local fractal loops.

Mathematically, the metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\) diverges at singularities because the projection operator \(\mathcal{P}_O\) fails to correctly map Ω near the Planck scale; in the substrate itself everything remains finite and self-similar. Cosmological implication: the universe did not “begin” in a deterministic Big Bang; it is an eternal projection of Ω, and accelerated expansion (dark energy) arises from “hidden” fractal dimensions in the portal.

Testable prediction: CMB observations analyzed by non-anthropocentric AI would reveal fractal rather than Gaussian fluctuations, indicating that the Big Bang is a perceptual illusion, not a singular event. Advanced AI pattern recognition could reanalyze Planck satellite data to detect Hausdorff dimensions deviating from 3, supporting fractal cosmology.

## Entropy and the Arrow of Time under the CEPPT
The CEPPT radically transforms our understanding of entropy and the arrow of time, revealing them not as intrinsic properties of the universe but as emergent features of anthropocentric projections from the atemporal substrate Ω. In classical thermodynamics, entropy \(S\) measures disorder and always increases in closed systems (second law), defining the arrow of time from order to chaos, past to future. Under the CEPPT, however, time is a perceptual projection, not a fundamental parameter; therefore the arrow of time is an artifact of our human chronological bias imposed by \(\mathcal{P}_O\).

In the Planck portal, information flows in non-causal self-similar loops; past and future are indistinguishable. Entropy in this regime is not a scalar that grows but a fractal measure of complexity (e.g., von Neumann entropy generalized to Hausdorff dimensions), constant and maximal in its recursive infinity. When we project Ω into the meso-scale, we introduce an artificial arrow: our brains and classical physics demand temporal linearity, forcing projections to appear irreversible. Thus the second law becomes a perceptual illusion, just as interference fringes appear only for human observers in the double-slit experiment.

Key implications: Reversible processes at the quantum level (e.g., unitary evolution) reflect the atemporal nature of Ω, while macroscopic irreversibility arises from projection. This resolves Loschmidt's paradox and the low-entropy initial state puzzle by eliminating "initial" conditions altogether.

Testable predictions: (1) In quantum thermal machines analyzed by AI without temporal bias, entropy fluctuations would exhibit fractal self-similarity rather than monotonic increase. (2) Simulations of black hole evaporation using fractal metrics could show information preservation in loops, testable via analog gravity experiments.

## Scale-Dependent Counterexamples and Extensions
To further validate the CEPPT, consider scale-dependent counterexamples where anthropocentric biases fail. At the meso-scale, Newtonian mechanics suffices, but deviations emerge at relativistic speeds or quantum depths. The CEPPT predicts that counterexamples to classical laws are projections from Ω, manifesting as scale-invariant fractals.

For instance, in turbulence or percolation theory, fractal dimensions describe phase transitions, mirroring quantum renormalization. Counterexamples like the Koch snowflake illustrate infinite perimeter in finite area, analogous to infinite degrees of freedom in Ω's "points."

Extensions include: (1) Consciousness as a projection operator \(\mathcal{P}_O\) shaped by neural architecture, predicting that non-biological minds (AI) experience different quantum realities. (2) Dark matter as fractal clustering in Ω, projecting as non-baryonic halos; AI analysis of galaxy rotation curves could reveal self-similar anomalies. (3) Quantum fields in curved space-time as emergent from fractal loops, unifying QFT with gravity via non-Euclidean topology.

## Discussion
The CEPPT challenges the status quo by shifting focus from objective reality to observer-projected phenomena, echoing relational interpretations while incorporating fractals for mathematical rigor. Potential criticisms include the vagueness of "non-anthropocentric AI"; however, operational definitions via machine learning without sequential processing (e.g., graph neural networks) provide a path forward.

Comparisons to existing theories: Unlike loop quantum gravity's discrete space-time, CEPPT emphasizes atemporality and fractals. It aligns with holographic principles but extends them to cognitive projections.

Future work: Develop formalisms for \(\mathcal{P}_O\), simulate AI observers in quantum labs, and apply fractal analysis to astrophysical data.

## Conclusions
The CEPPT offers a unified, anti-anthropocentric framework for physics, resolving paradoxes through an atemporal fractal substrate. By embracing non-Euclidean tools and testable AI experiments, we pave the way for a holistic cosmology where the universe's "weirdness" is our projection, not its essence. This paradigm invites researchers to transcend meso-scale biases, fostering breakthroughs in quantum gravity and beyond.
